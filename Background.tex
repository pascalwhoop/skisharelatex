\section{Background}
In the following chapter we will introduce some fundamental knowledge necessary to understanding the topic as well as our approach of developing recommendations for each sector. We will first define a clear terminology that will be used in the remaining chapters. Afterwards, an adaptation of the recommendations given by the \ac{WEF} are described which we consider the core ingredients of a digital strategy \cite{worldforumdigitalenterprise:2016}. Finally, the most holistic frameworks, applicable to many sectors, will be briefly introduced and described.
