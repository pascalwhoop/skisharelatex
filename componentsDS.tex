\section{Components of a digital strategy}
To develop a strategy for responding to the impeding changes accompanying \ac{I4.0}, a business should first investigate what components this strategy is composed of. While the goal of an \ac{I4.0} strategy is apparent, as it is usually congruent with the general economic goals of the business itself, the implementation of this goal is dependent on three fields:

%We also assume most readers have heard the terms Internet of Things, Industry 4.0 or digital transformation. The argument for why businesses need to carefully evaluate how they implement their strategy and why they execute certain activities can be split into three categories:

\subsection{Technology}
The concept of digital transformation suggests that the entire business goes digital. It also implies that companies will have to adapt to a range of new technologies %TODO cite world http://reports.weforum.org/digital-transformation-of-industries/an-introduction-to-the-digital-transformation-of-industries-initiative/

\subsection{Culture}
\citeauthor{hammer:2015, LucasJr200946} argue a core task of preparation is the adaptation of the organizational culture to enable openness to innovation and adaption to new market environments. Businesses need to be "results-oriented", allow their employees to have the "freedom to increase innovation"\cite{hammer:2015} and avoid a culture that "promotes hierarchy and maintain[s] the status quo [because it] will be resistant to disruptive technologies"\cite{LucasJr200946}.
